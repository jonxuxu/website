There's a lot of talk within the spaced repetition space about the awesomeness of spaced repetition. They say that the technique of reviewing knowledge in card format through progressive intervals is the best way of learning something for life.

Intrigued, I tried my hands on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the flagship spaced reptition app. As a newcomer, I found the UI to be extremely clunky and confusing. Regardless, it looked like it came from Windows XP.

So I, along with my spaced repetition fanatic friend Kunal, built a React Native app that's simple, easy to use, and pretty. It's called [Echo Cards](https://echocards.co/).
