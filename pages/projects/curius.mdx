# Curius

![cover img](/images/projects/curius/banner2.png)

[Curius](https://curius.app) is a browser extension that aims to solve the quality problem of the traditional browser experience. It lets you pocket sites that you find interesting or meaningful, and share them with your friends and groups. It supports sentence highlighting, PDFs and a tag, comment and reply system. Using Curius, I found that my browser experience became much less lonely and a lot more thoughtful. I helped my friends Marley, Noah and Yvonne code and [launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/curius) the project.

I think that there's a strong future for collaboration-based browsing to curate the best parts of the internet. The human elemnts of sharing the little curius (_wheeze_) little things we find on the digital beach seem to bring a lot more hidden gems when compared to the traditional SEO approach. So check us out, and happy browsing!
