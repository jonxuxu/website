It seemed like almost all of the NFT projects coming out these days are either not actually fun/useful or straight up scams built on hype. Continuing from our <Link href="/projects/moments">experiments</Link> with NFT projects that have real-world-value, we also created a passive game with a dynamic similar to the classic Mousetrap game.

The emphasis was on quality visuals, balanced mechanics, and a high fun factor. We collaborated with some contractors who were way better at animating, storyboarding and lore building than we were, and built the full stack ourselves. The game is live to play at https://legendsofvenari.com. There's a lot of design work that went into the dashboard, the various maps, the capture/fight mechanic, and marketplace. Game design is definitely one of the most fun things I've tried in tech!
