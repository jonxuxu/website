# Noisy

### November 2020 - January 2021

_The landing page. I'm pretty happy with how the dark cyberpunk vibe turned out!_

[Noisy](https://noisy.vercel.app/) is a bot that uses AI to generate and play music on the fly. It supports 17+ genres, and exists as a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=746757926735052931&scope=bot&permissions=3296256) and a [web player](https://noisy.vercel.app/player). This idea was spawned after I was playing around with really exciting music generation models from OpenAI [Musenet](https://openai.com/blog/musenet/l) and Google [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/). My goal is to help people share some cool musical experiences, so I'll keep the project running for free as long as I can.

When I started this project, I told myself that this time, I _will_ complete this thing. I set a reasonable scope, and had a simple goal. Interestingly, the majority of the project was built out during my time at a communal house in New Mexico, when there were maximum distractions. I'm pretty happy that things worked out and I got to make something to share with real users.

### Web player

If the site is still up, you can play with the web player embed below.

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "750px", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    frameborder="0"
    src="https://noisy.vercel.app/player"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

As of this writing, the Discord bot has been added to 200 servers, combining to a total of more than 128000 users. Another cool thing that happened was that I actually got a job offer from iDreamSky, after the CEO saw Noisy on [Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/noisy-2). I always thought that getting opportunities from personal projects was a Twitter fable, but this experience proved that it's actually very simple and common. So if you're wondering whether or not you should build that project you've always wanted to build for the longest time, just do it! (and do it because you're interested, opportunities will come naturally after that)

My big takeaway from this project is that music generation has now matured to a point where we can build agument digital meeting spaces with it as background music, to a really high degree. I think we'll see a lot more of this in the future.
