# Hackathons

I did a bunch (over 40) hackathons over the course of high school. I learned a lot, and made a ton of fun projects and great memories. [A lot has changed](/blog/2020-07-25-on-hackathons), but I owe it to these experiences for nurturing the joy I have whenever I'm building cool stuff with tech. Feel free to check out my projects on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/JonathanXu)!
