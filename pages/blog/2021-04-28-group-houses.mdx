# Under One Roof

Recently, there's been a lot of talk about living in group houses. By definition, they aren't anything new or complicated by any means. These co-living arrangements are just that - a group of people live together under one roof. Like geodes, they come in different arrangements and sizes, and there's something out there for everyone.

Group living arrangements can be totally [amazing](/blog/2021-03-11-travels), even transformative. I think they provide the best opportunity to make those lifelong friendships you can only have by living intimately together.

## What to watch out for

What worries me is that I'm seeing a growing reverance for being in specific co-living arrangements, especially in the gen-z demographic. What I mean is this: without pointing names, we can see a social media trend where people publicly share and humble brag about being in a name brand house.

This is worrying because it detracts from what group houses are really meant for. There is nothing special about the mere fact of being in a specific group house. It's a construct formed from having a bunch of people living together under one roof. It's a special experience because of the ideas you learn and the friends you meet and the memories you make, not because it's a shiny badge that should be flaunted around.

A house that focuses on clout and external validation tends to set a tone that makes it difficult to be authentic and organic. If you are surrounded by people who are in the place just so they can say they have been there, you most likely won't be able to get the level and type of interaction that you'd get with people who want to live, learn, and share alongside you.

What makes a house is the people within it. If people aren't coming for the experience, then it won't manifest within the house.

To be clear, I am in no way trying to gate-keep the awesome opportunity of group houses. I hope everyone gets to do them, but it should be a truly safe, community oriented experience that is honest with its values and purpose.

When finding housemates, I find that using [The Damn Test](/blog/2021-04-15-damn-test) to be a helpful litmus test on whether I align with someone and would like to live with them.

## The good part

Ok, so being in a good house is paramount to the experience. How do I make sure I'm in the right house? And if I find the right house, how can I be accepted to join as a resident?

After chatting with many friends from Waterloo who had the same questions, it seems that there are two main problems here:

1. It's hard to find out about these houses in the first place
2. It's hard to join these houses because they are very space-limited
