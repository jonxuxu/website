# Self-imposed poverty

In the wake of the ongoing stock market shock and crypto [meltdown](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/18/bitcoin-sinks-below-20000-as-crypto-meltdown-intensifies.html), I've been thinking about money a lot. Specifically, I've been quite confused with my relationship to money and how it has impacted my way of living.

A while back my friend and I were joking about how we would put thousands in crypto and stocks without much hesitation and barely even register a wince if our investments crashed, yet would spend so much time deliberating the petty dozens of dollars involved when choosing between two laptops. In objective terms, the costs and opportunities should correlate linearly with the amount of money involved - yet somehow my monkey brain justifies one dollar spent on investments differently that a dollar on expenses.

I think a big reason for this is that convoluted representations of wealth abstract away a lot of the value of the underlying dollars, in the same way that poker chips do it in casinos. On the other hand, the process of buying something clearly represents the value of the money I spend, in the form of the good or service I'm buying.

The end result of this is that I am unfazed by crazy swings in my portfolio, yet I live excessively frugally (my poverty-stricken upbringing also had a play in this), to the point where the effort put into deliberating and cutting costs ends up costing me more than if I paid a bit more. Spending more on what I actually care about, and less on vogue investments for the sake of 'security', I would have had a much better quality of life, and probably be financially the same as where I am now. My conclusion from this is that I should redefine my relationship to money, in particular:

> Stocks and crypto are only worth what they can be sold for in cash
> Cash is only worth something because it can be exchanged for goods and services

In essence, I should stop denying myself the ability to use money to get things done, buy things, and marginally improve my life. I see this pattern of thinking in many of my peers, especially in the career/future planning oriented folk. Extrapolating a bit, I am increasingly convinced that these groups of people (increasingly composed of genZ) are irrevocably defining their life mantras on a premise that they haven't even thought to question. Many people choose their careers based on a scarcity mindset - when is enough if you don't have a plan to spend your hard earned savings? And what do you do after you achieve financial independence 10,20,30 years down the line? I know there's a line between this an reckless spending, but for me at least I'll be trying to work from my extremes.
