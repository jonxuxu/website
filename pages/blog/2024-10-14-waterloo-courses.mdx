# My Waterloo Class Tierlist

#### 10/14/2024

At long last, I finished my undergrad! I can't believe that in two weeks, I'll be walking across the convocation podium dressed like a stage extra in a knockoff Harry Potter musical.

I enrolled in the Software Engineering program in 2019, got hit with the covid zoom university, took a year off to do startups, seriously considered dropping out, went back to school, and then switched to Computer Science to graduate almost (4 months late) on time this year. As I celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving today, one of the things I'm grateful for is the fact that I got to finish my degree despite all the shenanigans that I've been up to.

Now that it's all over, I'd like to share a short review for every course I took at Waterloo. You can also check out UWFlow for a much more comprehensive rating of classes - here you will just get my unfiltered, highly subjective, personal opion of how much I liked the courses and why.
