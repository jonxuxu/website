# What I want
#### 01/17/23

To know what I want so that I am not grasping for whatever everyone else wants at the time.

To be in my own lane. I don't want to be ahead or behind. I just want to be.

To enjoy and create beauty.

The wisdom to know what's worth doing and the skills to do it well.

To be grounded in the world around me, but not swept away by it.

To give and recieve love, even in a world that is so often unloving.

Friends who make everything fun.

Work that is so fulfilling that I would do it for free.

Inner peace that transcends space and time.

An identity that is enhanced by but not tied to things that will pass.

A natural ease in the way I go about things.

To not strain against coersive forces, and rather be wholly impartial to them.

Assurance that I will not lose myself in this life.
