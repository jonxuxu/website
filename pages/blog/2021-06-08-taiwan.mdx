### On startups, Taiwan, and things coming to a close

#### 06/08/21

Today is my last day in Taiwan before I fly back to Canada.

Looking back, a lot has happened:

- I made

i learned:

- its not hard to find traction, it's hard to find clarity and vision
- don't worry about VCs and funding, those can come through once you hustle on the right idea
  my next step is to educate myself about the ideas
