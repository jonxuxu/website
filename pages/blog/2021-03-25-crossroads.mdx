# The Crossroads

#### 03/25/21

![paths](/images/2021-03-25-crossroads/paths.jpg)

The question of the year - should I drop what I'm doing, reject all social and career norms, and fully embark on a self-directed journey of reflection and exploration?

I'm thinking this after I did some napkin math to discover that I could theoretically live off my savings alone for at least 5 years, if I'm frugal in a cheap city like Taipei. Now that resource scarcity can't be an excuse anymore, I'm finally forced to think about the big question.

If I avoid it even now, then that probably means I'll forever be finding new excuses to look away from the elephant in the room: what's the point in seeking a security in a future that isn't even yours? I'm already 20, it doesn't seem hard to continue living the same way for another 20, 40, 60 years until I die.

Is this the classic prelude to the big leap of faith? And how do those usually end up like?
