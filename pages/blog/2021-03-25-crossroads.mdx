# The crossroads

#### 03/25/21

The question of the year - should I drop what I'm doing, reject all social and career norms, and fully embark on a self-directed journey of reflection and exploration?

I'm thinking this after I did some napkin math to discover that I could theoretically live off my savings alone for at least 5 years, if I'm frugal in a cheap city like Taipei. Now that I can't use scarcity as an excuse anymore, I'm finally forced to think about the big question.

If I avoid it even now, then that probably means I'll forever be finding new excuses to look away from the elephant in the room: why seek security in a future that isn't even yours? I'm already 20, it doesn't seem hard to continue living the same way for another 20, 40, or 60 years.

Is this what it means to take a leap of faith? And how do those usually pan out?
