# The magic in the air

#### 9/11/2022

All my life, I've been subconciously searching for a group of people in which I felt a true sense of belonging. Belonging not in the sense of being formally recognized and accepted, but rather that sense of comradery when someone cares about the same things for the same reasons. I felt starved of that feeling of being on the same wavelength as others, of finding an equal in others.

I've found resonance in various communities, but all limited in scope and intensity:

- At home with family, living under the same roof and eating the same food, sharing blood ties
- From grade school to high school, the bonding factor was the countless hours of shared experience - memories and inside jokes during class and while waiting for the bus
- In various interest clubs - I share the same hobbies and pasttimes with others, but it was rare to bond further than this lowest common denominaor.
- In college, I was finally surrounded by people who loved to build and work in tech. But past that, the means and motivations diverge between classmates.

I'm grateful for these people in my life. Even if I didn't fully identify with these groups, I still share a genuine love and a strong sense of belonging. But something was still missing for me, and it was the most important feeling - spiritual companionship.

I felt alone in my efforts of discovering what I really cared about in life. Most of my friends were occupied by pressing matters such as getting financial security or the social pressures of success, and hadn't yet come to a point in life to stop and really question what they actually want to spend their time doing. Some have gotten jaded, and have silently given up on their childhood dreams in exchange for safety and security. And some choose not to confront this ultimate question because it would usurp the very foundations of their worldview - this is scary, and its much easier to use a logical fallacy to avoid thinking about it (ie "I'll think about this when I sell a startup and have 10 billion dollars").

Where were the fools who still dared to dream? Where were the optimists who actually take the leap and put time into persuing their ideal versions of life, no matter how stupid or useless or trivial it seemed? As the years went by, I began to doubt I'd ever find a community like this. There were many moments when I questioned myself and my open naiivite on how I could spend my life.

But here in SF, I think I'm finally getting close to it. Slowly, after following my nose through the social network, I am starting to meet the stupidly courageous, the infinitely imaginative, the artists, and the builders. Even though there is no evidence for it, I really believe that my people really do exist out there. But if they'd be anywhere, they'd be here.
