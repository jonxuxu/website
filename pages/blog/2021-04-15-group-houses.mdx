# Under One Roof

Recently, a lot of people have been talking about living in group houses. By definition, they aren't anything new or complicated by any means. These co-living arrangements are just that - a group of people live together under one roof. Like geodes, they come in different arrangements and sizes, and there's something out there for everyone.

With covid and quarantine shutting down society for most of us unlucky folks, people have increasingly looked to group houses to recreate little bubbles of serendipity. In fact, I was lucky to join one in the middle of quarantine, and it was an awesome experience.

- there is nothing special about being in a group house

- environment plays a role in how you behave, but if you surround yourself with people who arein a place so they can check that off then you are not in the right place

- damn test
