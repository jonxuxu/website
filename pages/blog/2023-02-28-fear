Why unhapiness in school? A big partis that it is hard to feel interest in the world during moments of danger and fear. It is especially prominent in college but is also true in the working world.

Job hunt, competition, grades - they are all the same: fear!

Example: sailing and enjoying the coastline vs boat is sinking.

The sense of impending doom is neverending. It only ends when 1) you are in your last year of school or 2) you learn to not fear.

1) is too little. Let's learn how to do 2).

To do 2) one needs self confidence. One only feels self confident when they feel loved. That's why having a supportive community is important!

People who love you, for yourself rather than for some objective. An intense affection, with vulnerability. Love that is freely given and graciously taken.
