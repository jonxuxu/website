# Brain Reconstruction Resources

#### 07/22/2023

The field of mind reconstruction from fMRIs, EEGs, and other noninvasive brain imaging techniques is going through a renaissance of sorts. It's the perfect time to work in this space: thanks to developments in deep learning, compute, and dataset gathering, our progress in understanding what's going on in our minds is mind-blowing (heh).

Here are some resources to get you started. This is an evolving list, so if you have any suggestions, please [reach out](mailto:contact@jonathanxu.com).

## Datasets

There are quite a few large open-source datasets, a few are listed below. For fMRIs it’s common practice to pretrain on the Human Connectome Project resting state dataset because it’s so large and can help your encoder learn the latent space well. Then you can fine tune on task specific datasets.

The MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit has a great [list of datasets](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods/OpenDatasets) as well.

## Competitions

These challenges are great to test your skills in a fixed environment. Many of them offer cash prizes, and the opportunity to have your work featured within the competition’s published paper.

## Papers

One of the best ways to learn quickly is to read up on foundational papers and then read the papers that cite them. Below are some papers to get you started. I also did a high level walkthrough of some legendary ones [here](/blog/2023-07-22-mind-reading).

## Research

If you’d like to do research, most professors are quite open to getting help! Just email them describing what about their work excites you, why you want to help, and how you can help. Most will reply.
