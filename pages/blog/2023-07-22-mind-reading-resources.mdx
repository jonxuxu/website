# Brain Reconstruction Resources

#### 07/22/2023

The field of mind reconstruction from fMRIs, EEGs, and other noninvasive brain imaging techniques is going through a renaissance of sorts. It's the perfect time to work in this space: thanks to developments in deep learning, compute, and dataset gathering, our progress in understanding what's going on in our minds is mind-blowing (heh).

Here are some resources to get you started. Reach out if you'd like to chat about this space!

## Datasets
There are quite a few large open-source datasets, a few are listed below. It’s common practice to pretrain on the Human Connectome Project resting state dataset because it’s so large and can help your encoder learn the latent space well. Then you can fine tune on task specific datasets.
<Table dataSource={datasets} columns={datasets_columns} />

## Competitions
These challenges are great to test your skills in a fixed environment. Many of them offer cash prizes, and the opportunity to have your work featured within the competition’s published paper.

## Research
If you’d like to do research, most professors are quite open to getting help! Just email them describing what about their work excites you, why you want to help, and how you can help. Most will reply.
